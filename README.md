# Customer Transaction Prediction

This project uses Machine Learning to predict whether a customer will make a transaction based on historical data.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior using historical features and predict if a customer will make a purchase.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
5. Visualization of results

## 📁 Files

- `Customer_Transaction_Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook with code and analysis
- `README.md`: Project overview

## 📌 Outcome

Successfully trained and evaluated machine learning models to predict customer purchase behavior with good accuracy.
